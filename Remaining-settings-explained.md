##Backlog overview  

* The Backlog Overview gives you a overview of what shows are wanted but not successfully downloaded by the Daily search. In case the episode has the color Yellow, Medusa will search that episode in a higher quality.    
![backlog-overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014505/7c9e80f6-d1b4-11e5-9171-11878ebf70d9.png)


##Manage Searches  

* This page will allow you to force a :  
  * Daily search  
  * Backlog search     
  * Find propers search   

![manage-searches](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014509/7cb0bdd4-d1b4-11e5-9010-06460c83c695.png)

##Episodes Status Management  

* Lets you change the Episode status of a certain type to another.  

![episode-overrview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014508/7cafb6fa-d1b4-11e5-89af-1e5c3c026d40.png)

First select the episodes that you want to change. For example you want to set all `skipped` episodes to `wanted`. When selected push on Manage.

![episode-overrview-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014507/7cafd18a-d1b4-11e5-8fcb-dd7e54259beb.png)

Now you see an new screen witch is almost identical, You now you have to select the `skipped` shows/episodes and set the new status that you want. In our example that is `Wanted` so select `Wanted` and click on Go. Now all the `Skipped` shows that you had selected are set to wanted. 


##Failed Downloads  

* Allows you to see the Failed Downloads list. 

![failed-downloads](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014608/02d49106-d1b5-11e5-9ed7-a7c11534f4a7.png)

This pages shows you an overview of all the NZB/Torents that are marked as Failed. In case an NZB/Torrent was wrongly placed in the list you have the possibility to remove it. From time to time you get a bad NZB/Torrent. To prevent Medusa from downloading that same file again you have to add it to the Failed Download list. (failed.db) Otherwise you run the risk that Medusa picks the same file again. If you use NZBtoMedia (nzbtosickbeard for example) this is done automatically. With other methods this is not always the case. When that happens you can go to your show and select the episode and sett he episode status to failed. Or you can click on the search glass at the end of the episode line for a manual search. You will get a pop-up screen asking if Medusa should mark the episode as Failed.  


##Missed Subtitle Management  

* Lets you search for missing subtitles of your shows.  

![sub-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014609/02ecdf72-d1b5-11e5-9d41-24f77c910d11.png)

First you need to select the language that you want to search. You can select an individual language or all that you have set in the subtitle settings.  

![sub-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7928052/13014611/02febefe-d1b5-11e5-8bdb-584ab7456bfc.png)
