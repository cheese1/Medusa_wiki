## Why do we need to use cookies?
A number of providers are protected with with a captcha, like google's reCaptcha. Medusa will not be able to login to these, as it cannot solve the presented captcha. When you use a browser login with your credentials and solve the captcha, your session will be stored in the browser through a number of cookies. At that point you will no longer need to login, until the coockies expire.

## The workaround
As a workaround for these providers, you can configure the provider with the cookies which you can read from your browser (like Google chrome). This article will guide you step in 1. finding out which cookies you need for your provider, 2. logging in to your provider in Google chrome and retrieving the cookies and 3. configuring the provider with the required cookies.
