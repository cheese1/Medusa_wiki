# **IN PROGRESS**

First you need send a POST request to /api/v2/auth/login and you should get an a response back containing the apiKey which will be needed for all future requests. This will be changed eventually to a JWT so make sure to check the response. The response should also contain the header `x-medusa-server` with a value of the current install version. If this header is missing the server is out of date or isn't actually a Medusa install, this can happen if the user provides an incorrect server address.
